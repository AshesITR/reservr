    abstract = {The package fitdistrplus provides functions for fitting univariate distributions to different types of data (continuous censored or non-censored data and discrete data) and allowing different estimation methods (maximum likelihood, moment matching, quantile matching and maximum goodness-of-fit estimation). Outputs of fitdist and fitdistcens functions are S3 objects, for which specific methods are provided, including summary, plot and quantile. This package also provides various functions to compare the fit of several distributions to the same data set and can handle to bootstrap parameter estimates. Detailed examples are given in food risk assessment, ecotoxicology and insurance contexts.},

    abstract = {evmix is an R package (R Core Team 2017) with two interlinked toolsets: i) for extreme value modeling and ii) kernel density estimation. A key issue in univariate extreme value modeling is the choice of threshold beyond which the asymptotically motivated extreme value models provide a suitable tail approximation. The package implements almost all existing extreme value mixture models, which permit objective threshold estimation and uncertainty quantification. Some traditional diagnostic plots for threshold choice are provided. Kernel density estimation with a range of kernels is provided, including cross-validation maximum likelihood inference for the bandwidth. A key contribution over existing kernel smoothing packages in R is that a wide range of boundary corrected kernel density estimators are implemented, which are designed for populations with bounded support. These non-parametric density estimators are also incorporated into the extreme value mixture model framework to describe the density below the threshold. The quartet of density, distribution, quantile and random number generation functions is provided along with parameter estimation by likelihood inference and standard model fit diagnostics, for both the mixture models and kernel density estimators. The key features of the mixture models and (boundary corrected) kernel density estimators are described and their implementation using the package demonstrated.},

    abstract = {The Erlang mixture model with common scale parameter is flexible and analytically tractable. As such, it is a useful model to fit insurance loss data and to calculate quantities of interest for insurance risk management. In this paper, we propose a generalized expectation–maximization (GEM) algorithm along with a clusterized method of moments (CMM) to estimate the model parameters. The GEM algorithm not only estimates the mixing weights and scale parameter of the model but also estimates the shape parameters of the model using a local search method. The CMM method enables to produce quality initial estimates for the GEM algorithm. As a result, the proposed approach provides an efficient algorithm that can fit the model to the body and the tail of truncated and censored loss data well and converges fast. We examine the performance of the proposed approach through several simulation studies and apply it to fit the Erlang mixture model to two real loss data sets.}
