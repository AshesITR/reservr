abstract: >
  While the problem of estimating distribution parameters from truncated data with fixed truncation points has readily
  available implementations in \proglang{R}, this is not the case for randomly truncated data, i.e. observations where
  the point of truncation varies by observation.
  In practice, it is often of interest to also consider the influence of other parameters (predictors) on the
  distribution of an outcome variable.
  We present the features and implementation of the \proglang{R} package \pkg{reservr} for a large class of
  distributions.
  The package provides a flexible interface to specify distribution families, provides algorithms to perform parameter
  estimation for censored and randomly truncated data based on (conditional) maximum likelihood, and exposes an
  interface to the \proglang{R} package \pkg{tensorflow} for training flexible neural network models on censored and
  randomly truncated outcomes based on predictors.
  Additional utilities for application in a general insurance context, as well as the usual sampling, density,
  probability and quantile functions are provided.
